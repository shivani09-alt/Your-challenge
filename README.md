I have used java language  for frontend coding and rest api for backend.
In this application  I have shown user list  in recyclerview and view pager both.
There is  menu simply opens and closes with the tap of the respective icons.
The people list will be showcased as cards. There would also be a carousel at the top, whose active slide represents the selected card/highlighted user.
The user can - Tap on any card in the list. The carousel’s active slide will change to the one with the tapped card’s user’s details. Scroll to the top to see the active slide.
Use the arrows/swipe gestures on the carousel to change the active slide. The selected card/highlighted user will also change accordingly.
In this application I have used library Picasso to load image ,Retrofit for rest Api,CircleImageView library to show userprofile in circle shape.
